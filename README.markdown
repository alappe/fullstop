fullstop
========

## Synopsis

Being tired of adding my dotfiles by hand on every box I get a new
account on, fullstop pulls down it's repostitory and with it all
submodules. It then links all files mentioned in the .fullstoprc
configuration files into the homedirectory.

## Usage

`curl https://raw.github.com/alappe/fullstop/master/bin/fullstop | ruby`

## License

BSD… it's a real simple script…
